                    There are methods to produce salt, the solar evaporation being the oldest method, its use a
                    practical only in warm
                    climates where the evaporation rate exceeds the participation rate, either annually or extended
                    periods.

                    Solar salt production is, typically, the capturing of sea salt water in shallow ponds where the sun
                    evaporates most of
                    the water. The concentrated brine precipitates the salt which is then gathered by the Dasolano salt
                    makers through the
                    process called kayod.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Usually, two types of ponds are used, first us the concentrated pond where the sea water from the
                    ocean or salt lake is
                    stored. The second is called the crystallizing pond or banigan, where the salt is actually produced.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    By noon, the salt beds turn white, indicating that salt crystal have been formed. Before the sunset,
                    the farmworker,
                    using a rake called kayod collects the crystal kamarin, then salt is packed in sacks ready to be
                    collected by buyers.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Salt makers start cleaning the tiled beds at the start of the salt making season in October and
                    harvest salt from
                    December to May before the start of rainy season.
