                    In the early part of the 18th century, Dasol was just a part of the settlement, which today
                    comprises
                    the
                    areas of the
                    municipalities of Mabini, Burgos and Dasol. Those places had no fixed boundaries then as they were
                    frontier settlements
                    covered with thick forests and coastal fishing grounds that teemed with various fish species.
                    Together
                    with eight (8)
                    other towns of Pangasinan, the place was within the territorial jurisdiction of Zambales province.

                    The town got its name from the medicinal herb “dosol” which abounded in the locality during the
                    Spanish period. The
                    leaves of this plant were greenish and oval in shape. It was a tuber relatively very low in height.
                    It was commonly used
                    to cure infected wounds, but was found to have the unusual characteristic of miraculously
                    disappearing (abandoning its
                    post) for unknown reasons, never to be located again. its name was frequently mispronounced as DASOL
                    by the Spaniards,
                    so that when the place was established as a municipality in the 19th century, DASOL became its
                    official name.

                    This work is written especially to trace the leaders of our municipality from the Spanish Regime to
                    the present time.
                    Thus, many portions are taken from several sources of records.

                    In an article found at the Library of Colegio de San Sebastian, it was stated that the Recoletos
                    friars were the ones
                    who built the Roman Catholic Church in the area. In the history written by theses friars, the
                    municipality was civilly
                    constituted in the year 1793 and the mayors are hereby listed below with the corresponding years the
