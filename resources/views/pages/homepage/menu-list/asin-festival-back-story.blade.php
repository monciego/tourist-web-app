                    Salt Industry and Salt Making has been one of the main sources of livelihoods and income amongst the
                    Dasolano families.
                    It is also one of the major products that have brought the tagline “Dasol, Home of Quality Salt”.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    The following year, 2009 another event was unveiled by Councilor Gwen Bustamante which featured
                    “Cultural Presentation

                <p class="mb-2">
                    In 2017, under the administration of Hon. Eric J. Versoza, an ordinance was enacted and authored by

                    the well-knowm
                    festivals of the country. In fact its name was derived from <span
